## How to Run:
1) See directions below for initializing the React app (using localhost:3000)
2) Install and run ganache-cli
3) Use a burner MetaMask account (have to create a new Google Chrome profile with a burner gmail for this - then reinstall Metamask on new Chrome profile)
4) Import the first address or two in ganache (using private key) into Metamask (should have 100 ETH in it)
5) Set your Metamask network to be your local ganache network (Localhost 8545 for me)
