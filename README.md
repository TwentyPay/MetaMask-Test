**How to run:**
1) Create a MetaMask test account (need to create a new Google Chrome profile for this)
2) Run Ganache CLI (I am on localhost:8545)
3) Set your Metamask network to be your local ganache network (Localhost 8545 for me)
4) npm install to install project dependencies
5) Yarn start or npm start and go to localhost:3000 in your browser
<<<<<<< HEAD
6) Once running, click "Enable Ethereum" and should prompt you to sign in to MetaMask
7) Then import a Ganache account to Metamask using a private key found in the Ganache CLI (accounts have 100 ETH in them) and then make sure new account is connected (upper left will show you in Metamask)
8) Try sending ETH to the "receiver" test account
